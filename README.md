# CMPS14 Example
Example code of basic usage of the [Devantech CMPS14](https://www.robot-electronics.co.uk/cmps14-tilt-compensated-compass.html) tilt compensated compass module.

This is a [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) project but the main.cpp code can be used in the Arduino IDE as well.

PlatformIO/Visual Studio Code does not have a serial plotter like the Arduino IDE has. A great alternative is [SerialPlot](https://github.com/hyOzd/serialplot).
